Feedback on presentation:
* people may get confused that we are talking about comparing lists of prepared questions
* connect the bigger problem to the problem we are working on
* what if I can't think of the frequently asked questions?
* text content definition is given --> how do we mine that for possible questions?
* known problem in Natural Language Processing
* this doesn't go along with having answers be videos
* tells the end users to fix things up
* if people start asking questions and we can't find answers, lecture is bad. need to fix lecture.
* getting into ai/human interaction matters
* NLTK textbook goes into simple q/a matching

Context of corporate training:
* There may not be as many external questions in the corporate space
* mini version of "the hammer"
